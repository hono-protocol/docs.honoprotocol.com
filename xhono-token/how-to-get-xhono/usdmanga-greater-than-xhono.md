**x** = Amount of $MANGA to be converted into xHONO

**A** = Amount of $MANGA already burned at the start of the xHONO launch

#### Simplified Explanation

Early participants will require fewer $MANGA tokens to convert into xHONO, while later participants will need more $MANGA to obtain the same amount of xHONO. As more $MANGA gets burned through conversions, the price of xHONO in $MANGA will increase.

#### **Effects of Monthly $MANGA Burn on xHONO Price**

The price of xHONO in $MANGA will continue to rise as more $MANGA is burned over time. Even if no additional conversions occur, any $MANGA burn will still drive the conversion rate upwards.
