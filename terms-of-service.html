<h3 id="1-the-services"><strong>1. The Services</strong></h3>
<h4 id="11-the-interface"><strong>1.1 The Interface</strong></h4>
<p>The Interface provides both web and mobile access to the fully non-custodial, blockchain-based software protocol known as the &#x201C;HONO Protocol,&#x201D; which operates on the Ethereum blockchain, and may extend to several Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in the future. The Interface is distinct from the HONO Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the HONO Protocol. The HONO Protocol consists of open-source, self-executing, autonomous smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. You may access the Interface via your non-custodial digital wallet, which allows you to directly interact with public blockchains. Your use of a non-custodial digital wallet is governed by the applicable terms of service of the third-party digital wallet provider.</p>
<p>New versions and upgrades to the HONO Protocol may be released from time to time, subject to the independent governance rules of the HONO Protocol. The Services may not be compatible with prior, abandoned or outdated versions of the HONOProtocol. HONO Protcol undertakes no responsibility or obligation to update or maintain the Interface to support legacy versions of the HONO Protocol. The Services may also become degraded or unexpectedly unavailable at times. To the extent you are using the Services to interact with the HONO Protocol, this could result in delays in accessing the HONO Protocol and your funds. We assume no responsibility or liability for any loss of, or delayed access to, your funds or otherwise delayed or failed transactions arising out of or in connection with any such degradation or unavailability of the Services.</p>

<p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (the &#x201C;<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>&#x201D;) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with HONO Protocol, its affiliates, successors, and assigns, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the &quot;<strong>HONO Parties</strong>&#x201D;). It also limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the HONO Parties.</p>

The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.</p>
<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of these Terms, the Services, or any connection you may have to the information you obtained from the Interface.</p>
<h4 id="53-terms-of-the-arbitration"><strong>5.3. Terms of the Arbitration</strong></h4>
